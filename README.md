# IvoryImpactIndex
This is code that I wrote while an intern at Ivory Innovations, a fund that specializes in innovative affordable housing solutions. We were assisting our partners at Impact Justice, a bay area based
non-profit that helps convicts find housing, by creating an index that sought to numerically approximate the suitably of a neighborhood to receive those recently out of prison. To create this index, 
we implemented several variables and weights relating to median household incomes, % over 21, Homeowner vacancy rates, non_white populations, homeownership rates, and walkablility. These variables are then
aggregated into a score, with higher scores indicating better suitability to receive and lower scores indicating lower suitablility. 

Our data sources specifically come from ACS 5-Year survey for the San Francisco-Oakland area and EPA Smart Location Mapping.
